![Dawid Loranc - avatar](/images/avatar.jpg "Dawid Loranc - avatar")

Hi! My name is Dawid Loranc. I started programming back in middle school, and it has been my passion ever since. My main language is JavaScript (well, TypeScript), and I work daily on building web applications. I created this blog when I became interested in machine learning, but now it’s primarily my way of sharing experiences and various thoughts.

### Daj Się Poznać 2017

![Daj Się Poznać 2017](/images/posts_thumbnails/daj_sie_poznac_2017.jpg "Daj Się Poznać 2017")

I took part in the ["Let Yourself Be Known 2017"](http://devstyle.pl/daj-sie-poznac) contest with a project that involved creating a bot that plays Starcraft, a popular e-sports RTS.

I eventually made it to the finals of the contest, where I placed 17th out of more than 900 blogs submitted.
