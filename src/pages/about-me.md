![Dawid Loranc - avatar](/images/avatar.jpg "Dawid Loranc - avatar")

Hi, my name is Dawid Loranc. I started programming when I was still in middle school and it has been my passion ever since. My main language is PHP, and I develop web applications on a daily basis. I recently became interested in machine learning, and I created this blog primarily to share my experience, thoughts, and also to systematize my knowledge of this rapidly growing field.

## Daj Się Poznać 2017

I took part in the ["Let Yourself Be Known 2017"](http://devstyle.pl/daj-sie-poznac) contest with a project that involved creating a bot that plays Starcraft, a popular e-sports RTS.

I eventually made it to the finals of the contest, where I placed 17th out of more than 900 blogs submitted.
