Hello World! Recently, while reading what people write on the **#blogreview** channel in the [Devs PL](https://devspl.slack.com) Slack team, I was inspired to create something of my own. Once upon a time, as part of a competition, I ran a blog for a while, but due to my laziness, the initiative quickly failed. This time I hope that my enthusiasm will last longer.

I will be writing this blog mainly about a field that has recently experienced great growth - machine learning. I'm not particularly advanced, but I'll try not to write nonsense.

Enjoy reading :)
