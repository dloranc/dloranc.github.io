Today I decided to take part in the ["Daj Się Poznać 2017"](http://devstyle.pl/daj-sie-poznac/) competition organized by Maciej Aniserowicz. The competition involves developing your own Open Source project on GitHub and running a blog by writing a minimum of two posts a week for 10 weeks. The project that I will be developing will be an AI playing Starcraft 2. I just have to count on the fact that by the time the competition starts, i.e. by March 1, DeepMind will provide an API for writing bots, which it is developing in cooperation with Blizzard.

All my competition posts can be found in the tag ["DSP2017"](/tags/dsp-2017).
